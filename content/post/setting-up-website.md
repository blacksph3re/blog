As this was my today's project, I will lose some words about how I set up this site. 

## Hosting
I am hosting at [uberspace](https://uberspace.de/), a very hipster shared hoster, which let's you choose your price yourself. Their hosting principle is a multi-user linux environment, where you automatically get a user assigned and some stuff provisioned. It relies on linux unprivileged users as the only isolation from other users on the same machine, so I would not recommend using the space for anything critical. However, I like the setup and how everything is documented, so I chose it as a hoster. I will just hope no other user on my machine uses a privilege escalation to modify my site. `#securitythroughprayer`

But everything was up to date, so I would rate the risk as pretty low.
