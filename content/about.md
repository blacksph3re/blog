# Hey there!

Nice you made it to my page! I am a student of computer sciences on the TU-Dresden (in Dresden), interested in these topics:

* **Cloud Computing** My favourite. Basically everything involving more than one computer: Microservices, Big Data, Fault-tolerance, Distributed (insert anything). I know C++, Rust, Go, Elixir
* **Backend Development** I have worked with the MEAN-Stack and python-django but am willing to learn something new
* **Websites** Have been creating websites for 6 years now, am familiar with several CMS and modern frontend frameworks (Angular, Bootstrap, JQuery). 
* **Software development** If I should get very desperate, maybe also classical non-web monolithic year 2000 Java standalones. But actually... no.
