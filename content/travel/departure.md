I successfully registered for an ERASMUS-Semester in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. I want to describe a little bit of how I decided to go, how the registration process worked for me and what I already experienced, before even leaving Germany.

At first, all the time I am talking to friends I found through my volunteering organisation AEGEE, they recommend me to do an ERASMUS semester. I am deeply in love with travelling. 

# How it began

Summer 2016 I participated on a summer university by AEGEE-Cluj Napoca, where we spent a couple of days in 8 different transylvanian cities - Cluj Napoca being one of them. It took me 4 days to fall in love with it. The culture of welcoming by both the municipality and the people on the streets impressed me deeply. It was such a nice contrast to the rejection I experienced during my volunteering in Dresden. The mere welcoming foreigners, the municipality offering rooms for projects with internationals - unthinkable in Dresden. I am an international spirit and I don't feel like that part is wanted here.
