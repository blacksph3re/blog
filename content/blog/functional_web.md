# Introduction

I recently tried to dive into functional programming and the longer I do that, the more I am amazed by how it feels to code functional. Thing is, all those languages provide quite an entrance barrier if you come from one of the common languages like PHP, Python or whatever. Even JS doesn't really feel too functional to me, as things like binding functions is still pretty unhandy and the callback hell is just not very nice to read through. Still, functional elements continously spread through the market and are hyped everywhere, as I find not without reason. It's very rewarding to learn those languages, it increases the fun in programming a lot. And also functional programming is advertised to be safer, more performant and more flexible, but that was not the reason I switched.

# Backend

So well, I tried to go the full monty right away, both backend and frontend in functional. For the backend I decided to stick to elixir phoenix. My first encounter was through `mix phoenix.new`. That command would spam the folder you run it on with various files, of which you have no remote clue what they are doing. As with learning any web framework, it is not adviced to try to find out right away, though I did. Actually I instantly gave up on the whole thing and did something else, as I was overwhelmed, but I came back some weeks later.
