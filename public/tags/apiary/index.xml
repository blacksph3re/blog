      <description>Introduction I assume you are generally familiar with microservices, otherwise I can recommend this article for further reading. Lets also assume we have a basic microservice architecture set up. So, why and how do we test it? Why: I won&amp;rsquo;t even start preaching about tests, just write a bigger project without testing. I guess every programmer has to do that at some point of his life. How: Most of the tests, and for some services all of the tests will be very straight-forward.</description>
